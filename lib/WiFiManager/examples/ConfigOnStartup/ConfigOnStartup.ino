/*
This example will open a configuration portal for 60 seconds when first powered up.
ConfigOnSwitch is a a bettter example for most situations but this has the advantage 
that no pins or buttons are required on the ESP8266 device at the cost of delaying 
the user sketch for the period that the configuration portal is open.

Also in this example a password is required to connect to the configuration portal 
network. This is inconvenient but means that only those who know the password or those 
already connected to the target WiFi network can access the configuration portal and 
the WiFi network credentials will be sent from the browser over an encrypted connection and
can not be read by observers.
