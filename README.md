# ESP para-site temperature logger
ESP based temperature, LED power and power time logger for LCD/DLP/SLA Resin machines

The idea for this project is to make use of the empty ESP01 slot available on the photon to make a logger to keep track of various temperatures and other data on a MSLA printer by acessing the ESP with a regular browser

Here is an example of the dashboard
