v0.2 - Second Release - Bed Bugs- 2019-04-07
	- Adds support for the BME280 Sensor (For Ambient Temperature, Temperature, Humidity and Altitude.)
	- Nearly all code has been refactored! (I just love saying that) Since we are relying on 3rd party open source libraries, 
		each one is a bit different in how it behaves. Refactoring has prioritized standardization across the main functions 
		and attempted to limit snowflakes to the functions that talk to the various sensor libraries.
	- HTTP server re-created as RESTful api with JSON returns. (Currently GET only)
	- Sensor data has been organized into 4 key groupings or "classes" 
		- Ambient - The room an environment in which the printer lives (Temp, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Altitude)
		- Chamber - The printing chamber itself. (Temp, Humidity, Dewpoint)
		- Optics - The LCD Screen and UV LED (UV, Visible light, IR light, LED Temp and LCD Temp)
		- Enclosure - The base of the printer that contains the MainBoard and Optics (Temperature)
		- All classes have a timestamp as part of the return value.

			- DHT12 (untested)
			- MLX90614
			- SI1145
		- Talks to DS3231
			- If time not set, sets time to Compile Time
			- Reads Timestamp
		- Writes all sensor data to Serial port
