/*
v0.3 - Third Release - Crabs - 2019-04-07
	- Removed DHT12 Support, temporarily, while I find a better library.
	- Migrated to Platform.IO for substantially better development experience.
		- Required refactoring code to make it fully C++ complaint. (I'm a Real Boy!)

/*
v0.2 - Second Release - Bed Bugs - 2019-04-07
	- Adds support for the BME280 Sensor (For Ambient Temperature, Temperature, Humidity and Altitude.)
	- Nearly all code has been refactored! (I just love saying that) Since we are relying on 3rd party open source libraries, 
		each one is a bit different in how it behaves. Refactoring has prioritized standardization across the main functions 
		and attempted to limit snowflakes to the functions that talk to the various sensor libraries.
	- HTTP server re-created as RESTful api with JSON returns. (Currently GET only)
	- Sensor data has been organized into 4 key groupings or "classes" 
		- Ambient - The room an environment in which the printer lives (Temp, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Altitude)
		- Chamber - The printing chamber itself. (Temp, Humidity, Dewpoint)
		- Optics - The LCD Screen and UV LED (UV, Visible light, IR light, LED Temp and LCD Temp)
		- Enclosure - The base of the printer that contains the MainBoard and Optics (Temperature)
		- All classes have a timestamp as part of the return value.

/*
v0.1 - Initial release! - Amebiasis - 2019-04-03
	- What it does:
		- Connects to Wifi
		- Launches a webserver
		- opens I2C communication
		- Talks to the following sensors:
			- DHT12 (untested)
			- MLX90614
			- SI1145
		- Talks to DS3231
			- If time not set, sets time to Compile Time
			- Reads Timestamp
		- Writes all sensor data to Serial port
		- DHT12 Temperature and Humidity are available by querying http://<ipaddress>/chamberTemp and /chamberHumidity
		- SI1145 UV index is available by querying http://<ipaddress>/uvledStatus
	-Lots left to do!
