si1145 - UV sensor

# The SI1145 has a fixed I2C address (0x60), you can only connect one sensor per microcontroller!


I2C RTC DS1307 AT24C32 Real Time Clock Module

# DO NOT USE A CR2032 (Non-Rechargable) battery, use a LIR2032 RECHARGABLE battery.  Using a non-rechargable battery requires cutting the charging circuit trace.

# This module has 4 particularities:

# It does not have a 3V CR2032 Lithium battery, but a rechargeable lithium battery LIR2032 , as well as its charging circuit
# The address of the EEPROM memory is not modifiable because there are no coding jumpers Pins A0, A1, A2 are connected to 0v. The binary address is therefore fixed at 1010000X (ie $ A0 in hexadecimal), where X is the R / W bit.
# The location of the resistance R7 ( quartz polarization in pin 2 ) is empty, it is normal and the module works perfectly like this
# The slot for U1 is empty, it can accommodate a temperature sensor ( not supplied ) “One-Wire” as a DALLAS DS1820 , or DS18B20 , etc …
